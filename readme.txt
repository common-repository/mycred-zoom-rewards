== Description ==
myCred Zoom addon awards myCred points to users for joining Zoom meetings. It is a gamification-based WordPress add-on that helps you award points upon joining Zoom meetings for registered users. This functionality is available for both the website and app. You will also have the flexibility to assign different myCred points to different meetings so users can earn from a wide variety of points. A dedicated hook has been integrated into the myCred hook page from where the admin can define the preferences/requirements to award points for joining zoom meetings. Admin canalso use the “limit” functionality to limit point distribution to: per day, per week, per month, in total, or no limits.
